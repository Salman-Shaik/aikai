        Founded in 2020 by Salman Shaik, A.I.K.A.I has come a long way from its
        beginnings from his MacBook Pro. When Salman Shaik first started out,
        his passion for suggesting people some movies or TV Shows to binge watch
        the weekend drove them to start this website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Salman Shaik being the person who has good knowledge about the Movies
        and TV Shows. Generally, people tend to ask him for suggestions about
        movies or TV Shows. Our Salman Shaik usually has a bad memory in things
        like this, but when it comes to work he is the master mind. He thought
        maybe making website to help his friends and acquaintances would help
        him and them equally. So that's were it all started.
      </p>

      <p>Stop spamming people for suggesting a movie, start using A.I.K.A.I</p>

      <p>Sincerely,</p>
